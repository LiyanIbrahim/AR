Iâ€™m really interested in exploring nonlinear storytelling, so I took this as an opportunity to experiment with it using AR. I wanted to augment different versions of the ITP bathroom experience. I was particularly interested in this because many posters were placed on the floor and hung next to the bathrooms. During a work meeting when we were designing a poster, someone asked, 'If you were in the bathroom and read that, would you want to go to this event?' That made me think about all the random conversations that could be overheard just by hanging out around the bathroom area. This assignment was my first attempt to overlay video materials onto bathroom posters around ITP, with content reflecting conversations overheard at ITP. Without context, the videos feel super random and out of place, but I think they add an interactive and fun element to the ITP bathroom experience. So far, I've only created two, but I still want to add more. However, I only want to augment posters that are always up and not the event posters that are constantly removed.
