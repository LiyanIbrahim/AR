During the class demo, I found myself contemplating the structure and essence of these filters and their potential effectiveness in creating a sense of abundance. I also considered the contexts in which such a feeling could hold significant power. Simultaneously, I've been reflecting on environmental issues within the realm of political activism, particularly due to my upbringing in a city where there was heavy censorship surrounding environmental protests and related actions. </br> 
With the assignment prompt, I wanted to think of ways of encouraging users to go outside and interact with such movements (regardless of what they are) and use the AR filters maybe during or even as a starting point. </br> 

I specifically envisioned a filter targeting the ongoing protests at Columbia University and their broader impact. These protests represent a historic and courageous movement, and my intention with the filter was to mobilize more individuals to support and stand in solidarity with the participants. However, I was cautious not to trivialize the seriousness of the situation. I wanted to ensure the filter conveyed respect and empathy for those involved, recognizing the real risks and consequences they face (for the students but also what is going on in Palestine).

Initially, I considered using watermelons as a symbol of resistance, but I ultimately decided against it. I worried it might come across as too lighthearted or playful, potentially undermining the gravity of the situation. </br>
