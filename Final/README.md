Idea: </br> 
I have always been intrigued by how social media, in a way, became one of the main sources of information and news for people and how that frames people’s views politically, particularly in the US concerning global events. It became particularly important and evident with the recent war on Gaza and how the New York Times is an active player in people’s opinions and framing global events in the US.  </br>
My project is a booklet with certain New York Times articles that cover the war and I made an AR filter that spawns comments and corrects the headlines to point out the biases of reporting the war.  </br> </br>
Process:  </br> 
I really enjoyed the week in which we did the image tracking, I think while a lot of what we learned was very impressive and good tools to use in the realm of political expression, I really wanted to use image tracking and headlines that are in a physical format to draw that contrast. 
I think having a physical booklet with the real headlines on your phone really plays into the tangible impact of these headlines and uses the medium well relative to AR.
