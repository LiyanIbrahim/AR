For this assignment, I was really intrigued by the concept of creating a garment out of unconventional materials. My main concern with this assignment was that I am unfamiliar with blender/3D modeling softwares and not that good with Lens studio. </br>
I wanted to create a piece that tackles the ideas of electronic waste and the environmental impact of electronic waste. </br>
I was looking through the materials assets and found a material that decomposes and disappears and I thought that this kind of animation is really powerful to illustrate what I wanted and I added it to the dress. But I also thought it was only obvious because I knew what I wanted and what it represented and the name of the material but as just an existing lens, I think the idea would have been lost. So the template I was using also had a coat asset so I decided to use it with the dress and add a material that has 2D wires and the recycle logo.  </br>
I kind of wish the coat was more 3D/looks more realistic/better because I really like the dress and how it goes with the outline of the coat but I donâ€™t think it was as effective as I wanted it to be.  </br>
